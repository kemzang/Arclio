  faq_eyebrow: "FAQ",
  faq_h2: "Frequently asked questions",
  faq_q1: "What video qualities can I download?",
  faq_a1:
    "Anything YouTube offers — 4K UHD (2160p), 1440p QHD, 1080p Full HD, 720p, 480p, 360p, and audio-only. High frame-rate streams (60 fps, 120 fps) and HDR content are preserved as-is. Arroxy shows every available format, including MP3, M4A/AAC, Opus, and WAV conversion for audio-only downloads.",
  faq_q2: "Is it really free?",
  faq_a2: "Yes. MIT licensed. No premium tier, no feature gating.",
  faq_q3: "What languages is Arroxy available in?",
  faq_a3:
    "Twenty-one, out of the box: English, Español (Spanish), Deutsch (German), Français (French), 日本語 (Japanese), 中文 (Chinese), Русский (Russian), Українська (Ukrainian), हिन्दी (Hindi), Afaan Oromoo, Kiswahili, O'zbekcha (Uzbek), Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese), አማርኛ (Amharic), العربية (Arabic), اردو (Urdu), پښتو (Pashto), বাংলা (Bengali), မြန်မာဘာသာ (Burmese), Ελληνικά (Greek), and Српски (Serbian). Arroxy auto-detects your operating system's language on first launch and you can switch at any time from the language picker in the toolbar. Translations live as plain TypeScript objects in src/shared/i18n/locales/ — open a PR on GitHub to contribute.",
  faq_q4: "Do I need to install anything?",
  faq_a4:
    "No. yt-dlp is downloaded automatically on first launch and cached on your machine; ffmpeg and ffprobe ship with the app. After that, no extra setup is needed.",
  faq_q5: "Will it keep working if YouTube changes something?",
  faq_a5:
    "Yes — and Arroxy has two layers of resilience. First, yt-dlp is one of the most actively maintained open-source tools around — it updates within hours of YouTube changes. Second, Arroxy doesn't rely on cookies or your Google account at all, so there's no session to expire and no credentials to rotate. That combination makes it significantly more stable than tools that depend on exported browser cookies.",
  faq_q6: "Can I download playlists?",
  faq_a6:
    "Yes. Paste a playlist URL, select all videos or only the ones you want, and Arroxy queues them as one batch. Whole-channel batch downloads are not supported yet.",
  faq_q7: "Does it need my YouTube account or cookies?",
  faq_a7:
    "No — and that's a bigger deal than it sounds. Most tools that stop working after a YouTube update tell you to export your browser's YouTube cookies. That workaround breaks every ~30 minutes as YouTube rotates sessions, and yt-dlp's own docs warn it can get your Google account flagged. Arroxy never uses cookies or credentials. No login. No account linked. Nothing to expire, nothing to ban.",
  faq_q8:
    'macOS says "the app is damaged" or "cannot be opened" — what do I do?',
  faq_a8:
    "This is macOS Gatekeeper blocking an unsigned app — not actual damage. The README has step-by-step instructions for the first-time launch on macOS.",
  faq_q9: "Is this legal?",
  faq_a9:
    "Downloading videos for personal use is generally accepted in most jurisdictions. You are responsible for complying with YouTube's Terms of Service and your local laws.",
