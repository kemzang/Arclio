# RTK - Rust Token Killer (Codex CLI)

**Usage**: Token-optimized CLI proxy for shell commands.

## Rule

Use `rtk` for shell commands after verifying that it is available on `PATH`.

Bootstrap check:

```bash
command -v rtk
```

If `rtk` is unavailable, run the command directly and mention that `rtk` was not found.

Examples:

```bash
rtk git status
rtk npm test
rtk pnpm test
rtk pytest -q
```

## Meta Commands

```bash
rtk gain            # Token savings analytics
rtk gain --history  # Recent command savings history
rtk proxy <cmd>     # Run raw command without filtering
```

## Verification

```bash
rtk --version
rtk gain
which rtk
```
