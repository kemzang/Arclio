Arclio owns yt-dlp runtime updates through a signed runtime-binary manifest. The app does not run `yt-dlp --update`, and it does not resolve upstream yt-dlp `latest` release URLs at runtime.

## Update model

Runtime startup resolves the latest Arclio runtime manifest from:

```text
https://github.com/antonio-orionus/arclio-runtime-binaries/releases/latest/download/runtime-index-v1.json
```

That `latest` pointer is for Arclio's manifest only. The manifest contents must list immutable upstream artifact URLs with concrete release versions, sizes, and SHA-256 hashes. Manifest validation rejects artifact URLs that contain `/latest`, requires HTTPS, and allowlists provider hosts.

Each `RuntimeBinaryIndexService` instance loads the index once and caches it in memory. A newly published signed remote manifest is therefore picked up by a fresh app/service run, normally after restart, not by polling during an existing session.

## yt-dlp candidate order

The build-time manifest generator resolves and verifies yt-dlp artifacts in this order:

1. GitHub nightly: `yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds`
2. GitHub stable: `yt-dlp/yt-dlp`
3. SourceForge stable mirror: `yt-dlp.mirror`

For each source, the generator reads the release's `SHA2-256SUMS`, records the artifact size and SHA-256, and emits raw executable entries for:

| Platform | Arch        | Asset name              | Executable path |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Windows  | x64, arm64  | `yt-dlp.exe`            | `yt-dlp.exe`    |
| macOS    | x64, arm64  | `yt-dlp_macos`          | `yt-dlp`        |
| Linux    | x64         | `yt-dlp_linux`          | `yt-dlp`        |
| Linux    | arm64       | `yt-dlp_linux_aarch64`  | `yt-dlp`        |

`runtimeEntriesForCurrentTarget` filters entries to the current OS/architecture without reordering them, so the manifest order is the runtime fallback order.

## Runtime fallback chain

`BinaryManager.resolveYtDlp()` tries candidates in this order:

1. Manual override from settings.
2. `ARCLIO_YT_DLP_PATH`.
3. Approved runtime manifest entries, in manifest order.
4. Valid managed artifact cache entries, newest installed first.
5. System `PATH` as the last resort.

The runtime index source order is separate:

1. Signed local manifest override (`ARCLIO_RUNTIME_INDEX_FILE` + `ARCLIO_RUNTIME_INDEX_SIG_FILE`; optional `ARCLIO_RUNTIME_INDEX_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE`).
2. Signed remote Arclio manifest.
3. Last-known-good cached manifest.
4. Bundled fallback index.

The bundled fallback index is intentionally narrow: pinned GitHub stable yt-dlp entries only. It exists to keep first-run dependency resolution possible when the remote manifest cannot be fetched or verified.

## Local development

Useful commands:

```bash
bun run runtime-manifest:generate
bun run runtime-manifest:validate
bun run runtime-manifest:sign
bun run runtime-manifest:local
bun run dev:runtime-manifest
bun run dev:local-manifest
```

Use `dev:local-manifest` when changing generator behavior and testing the app against a freshly generated signed local manifest.
