## <a id="features"></a>Features

### Quality & formats

- Up to **4K UHD (2160p)**, 1440p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p
- **High frame rate** preserved as-is — 60 fps, 120 fps, HDR
- **Audio-only** export to MP3, M4A/AAC, Opus, or WAV
- Quick presets: *Best quality* · *Balanced* · *Small file*

### Privacy & control

- 100% local processing — downloads go straight from YouTube to your disk
- **Open source** — every line auditable, MIT licensed
- Files saved straight to the folder you choose

### Workflow

- **Paste any YouTube URL** — videos, Shorts, and playlists supported; download the whole playlist or pick specific videos first
- **Multi-download queue** — track several downloads in parallel
- **Clipboard watch** — copy a YouTube link and Arroxy auto-fills the URL when you refocus the app (toggle in Advanced settings)
- **Auto-clean URLs** — strips tracking params (`si`, `pp`, `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`) and unwraps `youtube.com/redirect` links
- **Tray mode** — closing the window keeps downloads running in the background
- **21 languages** — auto-detects system locale, switchable any time

### Subtitles & post-processing

- **Subtitles** in SRT, VTT, or ASS — manual or auto-generated, in any available language
- Save next to the video, embed into `.mkv`, or organize into a `Subtitles/` subfolder
- **SponsorBlock** — skip or chapter-mark sponsors, intros, outros, self-promos
- **Embedded metadata** — title, upload date, channel, description, thumbnail, and chapter markers written into the file

| Platform | Format   |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |

### <a id="why-warning"></a>Why you may see a warning

Arroxy is open-source and MIT-licensed. The Windows and macOS builds are **not code-signed** — Apple Developer ID and Windows EV code-signing certificates each cost hundreds of dollars per year, which an indie project pays out of pocket. Without those signatures, Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper will warn you on first launch. The warnings mean *your OS doesn't recognize the publisher* — they don't mean Arroxy is malware.

Three ways to verify Arroxy yourself, in increasing rigor:

- **Read the source.** Every line is on [GitHub](https://github.com/antonio-orionus/Arroxy) and you can [build it from source](#tech).
- **Check the SHA256.** Match your file against the published [`SHA256SUMS`](../../releases/latest) — see [Verify your download](#verify) below.
- **Run a third-party scan.** Upload the file to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).

### <a id="windows-first-launch"></a>Windows first launch

On first launch you may see **"Windows protected your PC"** or **"Unknown publisher."** This applies to both `Arroxy-Setup-*.exe` and `Arroxy-Portable-*.exe`. Arroxy is free and open-source and the Windows builds are not code-signed with a paid certificate, which is why SmartScreen flags them. It does **not** automatically mean Arroxy is unsafe. To continue:

<div align="center">
  <img src="build/win-smartscreen-more-info.png" width="46%" alt="SmartScreen "Windows protected your PC" dialog with the "More info" link highlighted" />
  <img src="build/win-smartscreen-run-anyway.png" width="46%" alt="SmartScreen dialog after expanding More info, showing the "Run anyway" button" />
</div>

1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.

#### If Windows Defender flags or removes the file

Defender heuristics sometimes flag unsigned NSIS installers and Electron portables as suspicious. If Defender quarantines `Arroxy-Setup-*.exe` or `Arroxy-Portable-*.exe`, restore it from **Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Protection history**, then add the Arroxy executable as an allowed item under **Manage settings → Add or remove exclusions**. As with SmartScreen, the trigger is the missing publisher signature, not detected malware.

> Only download Arroxy from the official GitHub Releases page. If you got the file from another website or someone sent it to you, delete it and download a fresh copy from the official source. The source code is public, so you can inspect it or build Arroxy yourself if you prefer.

### <a id="macos-first-launch"></a>macOS first launch

Arroxy is not yet code-signed for macOS, so Gatekeeper will block the first launch. The exact path to allow it depends on your macOS version — Sequoia 15 tightened the old right-click → Open bypass.

#### macOS Sequoia 15 and later (current)

On Sequoia 15 and newer, right-click → Open no longer bypasses Gatekeeper for many quarantined apps. Use the System Settings panel instead:

1. Drag `Arroxy.app` from the mounted DMG into `/Applications`.
2. Double-click Arroxy. The block dialog appears — click **Done** (don't click *Move to Trash*).
3. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and scroll to the **Security** section. You'll see *"Arroxy was blocked to protect your Mac"* (or a near-identical message).
4. Click **Open Anyway**, confirm with your password or Touch ID, then re-launch Arroxy from `/Applications`.

#### macOS Sonoma 14 and earlier

1. Drag `Arroxy.app` from the mounted DMG into `/Applications`.
2. Right-click (or Control-click) `Arroxy.app` in `/Applications` and choose **Open**.
3. The warning dialog now has an **Open** button — click it and confirm. Arroxy opens normally and the warning never appears again.

#### "App is damaged" or persistent Gatekeeper block — Terminal fix

If macOS says *"Arroxy is damaged and can't be opened"*, or none of the steps above clear the block, the quarantine attribute on the DMG is the cause (some browsers and macOS's own translocation behavior set it). Strip it from the installed app:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Arroxy.app
```

**Apple Silicon vs Intel:** on an M-series Mac (M1 / M2 / M3 / M4), download the `arm64` DMG. On Intel Macs, download the `x64` DMG. Running the wrong build still works via Rosetta but is noticeably slower.

> macOS builds are produced via CI on Apple Silicon and Intel runners. If you hit issues, please [open an issue](../../issues) — feedback from macOS users actively shapes the macOS testing cycle.

### <a id="linux-first-launch"></a>Linux first launch

AppImages run directly — no installation. You just need to mark the file as executable.

**File manager:** right-click the `.AppImage` → **Properties** → **Permissions** → enable **Allow executing file as program**, then double-click.

**Terminal:**

```bash
chmod +x Arroxy-*.AppImage
./Arroxy-*.AppImage
```

If launch still fails, you may be missing FUSE:

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install -y libfuse2

# Fedora
sudo dnf install -y fuse-libs

# Arch
sudo pacman -S fuse2
```

**Optional desktop integration:** install [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) once, and any AppImage you double-click gets registered into your launcher menu automatically — no manual `.desktop` file needed.

**Flatpak (sandboxed alternative):** download `Arroxy-*.flatpak` from the same release page.

```bash
flatpak install --user Arroxy-*.flatpak
flatpak run io.github.antonio_orionus.Arroxy
```

<details>
<summary><strong><a id="verify"></a>Verify your download (SHA256)</strong></summary>

Every release publishes a `SHA256SUMS` file alongside the binaries. To check that your download wasn't corrupted or tampered with in transit, hash your file locally and match the line in `SHA256SUMS`. Open the latest release page → **Assets** → download `SHA256SUMS`.

**Windows (PowerShell or Command Prompt):**

```powershell
certutil -hashfile Arroxy-Setup-<version>.exe SHA256
```

**macOS (Terminal):**

```bash
shasum -a 256 Arroxy-<version>-arm64.dmg
```

**Linux (Terminal):**

```bash
sha256sum Arroxy-*.AppImage
```

Want a third-party malware scan? Upload the file at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com). A handful of generic-heuristic flags from minor engines is normal for unsigned Electron apps; widespread detections from major engines would be a real concern.

**Recommendation:** use the NSIS installer for auto-updates and faster startup. Use the portable `.exe` for a no-install, no-registry option.

## <a id="privacy"></a>Privacy

Downloads are fetched directly via [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) from YouTube to the folder you pick — nothing routed through a third-party server. Watch history, download history, URLs, and file contents stay on your device.

Arroxy sends anonymous, aggregate telemetry via [OpenPanel](https://openpanel.dev) — just enough for an indie project to understand launches, OS, app versions, and crashes. No URLs, video titles, file paths, account info, fingerprinting, or personal data. The per-install ID is random and not tied to your identity. You can opt out in Settings.

## <a id="faq"></a>FAQ

**Is it really free?**
Yes — MIT licensed, no premium tier, no feature gating.

**What video qualities can I download?**
Anything YouTube serves: 4K UHD (2160p), 1440p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, plus audio-only. 60 fps, 120 fps, and HDR streams are preserved as-is.

**Can I extract just the audio as MP3?**
Yes. Pick *audio-only* in the format menu and choose MP3, M4A/AAC, Opus, or WAV.

**Do I need a YouTube account or cookies?**
By default, no — Arroxy works without a YouTube account, login, or cookie export. Optional cookie support is available in Advanced settings (Cookies source: file or browser) for content that requires authentication, such as age-restricted or members-only videos. It is off by default. If you enable it, yt-dlp's wiki notes that [cookie-based automation can flag a Google account](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies); a throwaway account is the safer choice in that case.

**Will it keep working when YouTube changes something?**
yt-dlp is updated automatically on launch, and Arroxy ships fixes promptly when YouTube changes something. If you ever do hit an issue, optional cookie support is available in Advanced settings as a fallback.

**What languages is Arroxy available in?**
Twenty-one, out of the box: English, Español (Spanish), Deutsch (German), Français (French), 日本語 (Japanese), 中文 (Chinese), Русский (Russian), Українська (Ukrainian), हिन्दी (Hindi), Afaan Oromoo, Kiswahili, O'zbekcha (Uzbek), Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese), አማርኛ (Amharic), العربية (Arabic), اردو (Urdu), پښتو (Pashto), বাংলা (Bengali), မြန်မာဘာသာ (Burmese), Ελληνικά (Greek), and Српски (Serbian). Arroxy auto-detects your operating system's language on first launch and you can switch at any time from the language picker in the toolbar. Translations live as plain TypeScript objects in src/shared/i18n/locales/ — open a PR on GitHub to contribute.

**Do I need to install anything else?**
No. yt-dlp is downloaded automatically on first launch and cached on your machine; ffmpeg and ffprobe ship with the app. After that, no extra setup is needed.

**Can I download playlists or whole channels?**
Yes for playlists: paste a playlist URL, then queue the whole list or only the videos you select. Whole-channel batch downloads are not supported yet.

**macOS says "the app is damaged" — what do I do?**
That's macOS Gatekeeper blocking an unsigned app, not actual damage. See ["App is damaged" — Terminal fix](#macos-first-launch) for the one-line `xattr` command that clears it.

**Is downloading YouTube videos legal?**
For personal, private use it is generally accepted in most jurisdictions. You are responsible for complying with YouTube's [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and your local copyright laws.

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

### App won't open / no window appears

The Arroxy process starts but no window shows up. Most often this is a GPU driver hang during startup. Try, in order:

**1. Check the log.** It records startup, GPU info, and any crash. Path:

| Platform | Path                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\Arroxy\logs\main.log`                  |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Logs/Arroxy/main.log`                  |
| Linux    | `~/.config/Arroxy/logs/main.log`                  |

**2. Launch with hardware acceleration disabled.** Open a terminal / Command Prompt and run the executable with a flag:

```bash
# Windows (Portable) — PowerShell, run from the folder containing the exe
.\Arroxy-Portable-<version>.exe --disable-gpu

# Windows (Portable) — Command Prompt (cmd.exe), from the same folder
Arroxy-Portable-<version>.exe --disable-gpu

# Windows (Installed) — works in both PowerShell and cmd.exe
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Arroxy\Arroxy.exe" --disable-gpu

# macOS
/Applications/Arroxy.app/Contents/MacOS/Arroxy --disable-gpu

# Linux (AppImage)
./Arroxy-*.AppImage --disable-gpu
```

If that works, the GPU/driver is the cause. Make the change permanent (next step).

**3. Persist the flag via `argv.json`.** Create the file at:

| Platform | Path                                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\Arroxy\argv.json`                  |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/Arroxy/argv.json` |
| Linux    | `~/.config/Arroxy/argv.json`                  |

With contents:

```json
{ "disable-hardware-acceleration": true }
```

Arroxy reads this before opening any window, so it works even when the window never appeared.

**4. Other flags worth trying** (combine if needed): `--disable-software-rasterizer`, `--disable-gpu-sandbox`, `--in-process-gpu`.

**5. Stale window position.** If the window may be opening off-screen (multi-monitor change since last run), delete `<userData>\window-state.json` and relaunch.

**6. Still stuck?** Open an issue with: OS version, the contents of `main.log`, and any output from running with `--enable-logging --v=1`.
