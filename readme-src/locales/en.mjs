### Prerequisites — all platforms

| Tool | Version | Install |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| Git  | any     | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |
| Bun  | latest  | see per-OS below |

### Windows

\`\`\`powershell
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
\`\`\`

No native build tools required — the project has no native Node addons.

### macOS

\`\`\`bash
xcode-select --install
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
\`\`\`

### Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)

\`\`\`bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Electron runtime deps
sudo apt install -y libgtk-3-0 libnss3 libasound2t64

# E2E tests only (Electron needs a display)
sudo apt install -y xvfb
\`\`\`

### Clone & run

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/antonio-orionus/Arroxy
cd arroxy
bun install
bun run dev          # hot-reload dev build
\`\`\`

### Build a distributable

\`\`\`bash
bun run build        # typecheck + compile
bun run dist         # package for current OS
bun run dist:win     # cross-compile Windows portable exe
\`\`\`

> yt-dlp is fetched from GitHub on first launch and cached in your app data folder. ffmpeg and ffprobe are bundled with every Arroxy release.

  faq_q5: "Will it keep working when YouTube changes something?",
  faq_a5:
    "Two layers of resilience: yt-dlp updates within hours of YouTube changes, and Arroxy doesn't rely on cookies that expire every ~30 minutes. That makes it noticeably more stable than tools that depend on exported browser sessions.",
  faq_q6: "What languages is Arroxy available in?",
  faq_a6:
    "Twenty-one, out of the box: English, Español (Spanish), Deutsch (German), Français (French), 日本語 (Japanese), 中文 (Chinese), Русский (Russian), Українська (Ukrainian), हिन्दी (Hindi), Afaan Oromoo, Kiswahili, O'zbekcha (Uzbek), Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese), አማርኛ (Amharic), العربية (Arabic), اردو (Urdu), پښتو (Pashto), বাংলা (Bengali), မြန်မာဘာသာ (Burmese), Ελληνικά (Greek), and Српски (Serbian). Arroxy auto-detects your operating system's language on first launch and you can switch at any time from the language picker in the toolbar. Translations live as plain TypeScript objects in src/shared/i18n/locales/ — open a PR on GitHub to contribute.",
  faq_q7: "Do I need to install anything else?",
  faq_a7:
    "No. yt-dlp is downloaded automatically on first launch and cached on your machine; ffmpeg and ffprobe ship with the app. After that, no extra setup is needed.",
  faq_q8: "Can I download playlists or whole channels?",
  faq_a8:
    "Yes for playlists: paste a playlist URL, then queue the whole list or only the videos you select. Whole-channel batch downloads are not supported yet.",
  faq_q9: 'macOS says "the app is damaged" — what do I do?',
  faq_a9:
    "That's macOS Gatekeeper blocking an unsigned app, not actual damage. See the [first-time launch on macOS](#download) section for the fix.",
